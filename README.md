# Payroll Analysis in Los Angeles City

This project is aimed at answering the following questions about Los Angeles City employees' payroll information:

1. Do Police Officer-II employees have a better chance of receiving Temporary Bonus Pay?
2. Are employees who receive Permanent Bonus Pay most likely to be from the Public Works-Sanitation Department?
3. Do employees working in the Water and Power (DWP) Department have a better chance of working overtime?
4. Was the complaint by Recreation and Parks Department employees in 2014 that they were denied Longevity Bonus Pay justified by the data?
5. Is the claim by a Senior Clerk Typist from the Harbor (Port of LA) Department that they have higher Average Health Costs than their counterpart in the Water and Power (DWP) Department supported by the data?

## Methodology

1. The data will be cleaned to handle empty fields.
2. Hypothesis testing will be used to answer each of the questions.
3. The sample size, randomization, and other relevant factors will be considered to ensure sound conclusions.
4. Graphs and experimental results will be included to support the conclusions.

## Conclusion

The final results of the payroll analysis will be presented in the form of answer to each of the questions stated above. The methodology and intermediate steps used to reach the conclusions will be documented in the code as comments.
